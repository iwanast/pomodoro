The POMoDORo is a kind of pomodoro and has different themes for a customer to choose from and the customer can on his own choose the duration of the focus-time. 

It is the first project in the modul "the fundamentals" from HyperIsland which was a four weeks modul. 
I used for the first time Sass and JavaScript next to HTML5. 
The timer works and can be customized. The forms are there to see how it would look when working longer on the project.
